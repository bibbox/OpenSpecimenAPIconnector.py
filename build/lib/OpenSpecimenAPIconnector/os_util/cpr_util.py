    """Handles the API calls to registrate participants to a Collection Protocol

    Handles the OpenSpecimen API calls to registrate paritcipants to a existing Collection Protocol.
    This class can create participants, register existing participants to another protocol,
    get the details of an existing participant or more existing pariticpants, update a participant.

    Notes
    -----
    In order to use this and also the other classes, the user has to know OpenSpecimen. 
    The API calls are documented in https://openspecimen.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CAT/pages/1116035/REST+APIs and 
    the calls refer to this site. More details can be seen in the documentation.

    Example
    -------

    A code example, where the Institutes are handled is in the Jupyter-Notebook:
