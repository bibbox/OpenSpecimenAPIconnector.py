    """Handles the API calls to registrate participants to a Collection Protocol

    Handles the OpenSpecimen API calls to registrate participants to an existing Collection Protocol.
    This class can create participants, register existing participants to another protocol,
    get the details of an existing participant or more existing participants, update a participant.

    Note
    -----
    In order to use this and also the other classes, the user has to know OpenSpecimen. 
    The API calls are documented in https://openspecimen.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CAT/pages/1116035/REST+APIs and 
    the calls refer to this site. More details can be seen in the documentation.
